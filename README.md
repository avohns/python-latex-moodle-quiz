# python-latex-moodle-quiz
These are some examples/templates for batch generating parameterized moodle quiz questions (includig both cloze and essay type questions) using the `moodle` and `python` packages for LaTeX.

[Zur deutschen Version dieses README wechseln](https://github.com/avohns/python-latex-moodle-quiz/blob/master/README-GER.md)

Prerequisites
=============

1. LaTeX installed and working
1. Python (>=3.6) installed and working
1. LaTeX packages installed and working:
   1. `moodle` see https://ctan.org/pkg/moodle
   1. `python` see https://github.com/brotchie/python-sty (at least if you are working on Windows)
1. If you want to include any kind of images (static, dynamic), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) has to be installed and working.
   
Usage/Workflow
==============

The folders `simple-examples-ger` and `simple-examples-eng` contain more straightforward minimal examples (in either English or German), the `àdvanced-examples-`-Folders contain some actual use cases from my university teaching in the teacher education program.

1. Familiarize yourself with the documentation of the `moodle` package, which can be found [here](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/moodle/moodle.pdf).
1. Open and edit any of the example .tex files in your favourite LaTeX-Editor.
1. Compile the file with `pdflatex` or `lualatex`. You will have to set the `--shell-escape` flag because we are calling Python.
1. You will get an intermediate .py file, a .pdf file and a -moodle.xml file as a result (and possibly some additional .png files depending on what example you work with). However, for importing your questions into moodle you will only need the -moodle.xml file.
1. Import the -moodle.xml file into your question bank within moodle. If not specified otherwise, all questions will be stored inside a category which is named according to the quiz title used in the respective .tex file.
1. Create a quiz activity and choose a random question from the respective category.

How this works
==============

The basic structure of any of the examples looks like this:

1. You have got your standard LaTeX document (header, body).
1. The header should call both packages and, if you want to use additional raw HTML, choose T1 font encoding. If you want to use images, also include the `graphicx` package (see below):
    ```latex 
    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
	\usepackage{graphicx}
    \usepackage{moodle}
    \usepackage{python}
    ```
1. Inside the body you have a `quiz` environment (see example below), which is interpreted according to rules defined by the `moodle` package, which interprets and compiles the code into both the usual .pdf file and an additional -moodle.xml file once `pdflatex` is invoked.
    ```latex
    \begin{quiz}{quiz title}
      ...
    \end{quiz}
    ```
1. The `quiz` environment contains a `python` environment contains at least one main `for` loop (see example below). As soon as `pdflatex` is invoked, it in turn invokes Python, which then iterates through the `for` loop several times and dynamically adds a piece of LaTeX code in each of these iterations, which in turn is again interpreted by `pdflatex` and compiled into moodle-xml-code.
    ```latex
    \begin{python}
    for x in range(2,10):
      ...
    \end{python}
    ```
1. The `for` loop contains at least one `print` command with a multiline f-string that includes at least one type of questions envoirnment (multiple-choice, numerical (see example below), short answer, essay, matching, embedded answers (cloze), see section 3 of the `moodle` package documentation for details). 
    ```python
    print(rf"""\begin{{numerical}}
      ${x} + {y} =$
      \item {x+y} 
    \end{{numerical}}""")
    ```
1. Each question contains some variables (e.g. `x`and `y`in the example above) which are dynamically changed with each iteration of the `for` loop creating a different question with each iteration.

Known Limitations
=================

Restrictions on interpreted LaTeX commands
------------------------------------------

The set of LaTeX commands getting converted to HTML and included in the resulting -moodle.xml file is limited (please refer to section 4 of the `moodle` package documentation for details). 

If you want to use additional HTML for layout purposes (e.g. lists or tables), you can include raw HTML inside your LaTeX document. Unfortunately, the raw HTML code will also be visible in the resulting PDF document.

Graphics
--------

It is both possible to include static images and to create images dynamically using `python` (even [TikZ](https://pgf-tikz.github.io/) may be invoked). Any images included will be converted into .png files, which in turn are base64 encoded and directly included into the -moodle.xml file during compilation. 

You should specify the image dimensions (width, height in either cm or inch) and the conversion depends on a dpi setting (if not defined specifically, 103 dpi will be used as a default). Please refer to section 5 of the `moodle` package documentation for more details. 

In my experience, it is advisable to strictly stick to png files, as the conversion via ImageMagick implemented by the `moodle` package is a bit prone to errors.

Encoding/Umlauts
----------------

The `moodle`-package does not play nicely with utf-8 text encoding if you are using `pdflatex`. You can try to work around that by e.g. writing  German umlauts (Ä, Ö, Ü, ä, ö, ü, ß) in code (`\"A, \"O, \"U, \"a, \"o, \"u und \ss{}`). This may have been fixed in version 0.8 of the `moodle`-package.

If you experience encoing related problems, you should consider switching to `lualatex` which even supports utf-8 encodings in combination with older versions of the `moodle`-package. 

On Windows you may still run into problems with the `python`-package and utf-8 encoding, which can be resolved by manually resetting standard-i/o-encoding. Include this code snippet at the beginning of your `python` environment:
````python
import sys
sys.stdin.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
````

Shuffling answers in embedded questions
---------------------------------------

The `moodle` package was written before shuffling answers was introduced for subquestions inside embedded questions in moodle (>= 3.0). 

If you want to use shuffled answers for subquestions inside embedded questions, you have to include another `python` environment below the `quiz` environment inside the TeX document's body to change the questions type directly within the -moodle.xml file (please refer to https://bit.ly/2ZbQnTB for more details on the different types of subquestions). 

Let us suppose our xml file is e.g. `example-moodle.xml`and we have a `MULICHOICE` question. We then need to change each occurence of `MULICHOICE` to `MULTICHOICE_S`, which can be achieved with the following bit of code:

```python
with open("example-moodle.xml", "rt") as fin:
  with open("example-shuffled-moodle.xml", "wt") as fout:
    for line in fin:
      fout.write(line.replace('MULTICHOICE:', 'MULTICHOICE_S:'))
```

Limitations inherited from the usable question types
----------------------------------------------------

As the `moodle` package only uses standard moodle question types, the generated questions should be useable on any moodle installation, there are no additional plugins required whatsoever (the MathML filter should be set to active in your moodle installation if you want to display formulas written in TeX code).

These question types come with their own set of limitations. For STEM subjects you might want to check answers for algebraic equivalence, which is simply not possible with these question types. You might want to check out the [STACK](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_stack) or [WIRIS](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?id=26) plugins for such purposes.
